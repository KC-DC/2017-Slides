# Modeling Settlers of Catan with Degrees of Freedom

Download the [source code](https://github.com/michaellperry/dof) and follow along.

A [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ2cYjUKWKE) was recorded at Code on the Beach. The lighting was bad, but you can generally see the screen.

I wrote a blog post about [degrees of freedom](http://qedcode.com/content/degrees-freedom.html) that spawned this entire conversation.

Thanks for your support! See you next year.
