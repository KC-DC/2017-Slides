### Being Efficient With Azure Automation ###
*Individual humans do not scale very well. Let's face it, we can barely multitask. So with Cloud Computing how do we keep up with the growing demand for maintenance tasks for these "infinitely scalable" assets? The answer is automation.*

*Azure Automation is a highly available automation service which helps you "Automate all the things". Anything from deployments, to monitoring to maintenance tasks can be set up using this reliable workflow execution engine. This presentation covers the fundamentals of the Azure Automation service and provides some insights into how to leverage it with your own solutions.*

### An Introduction to Azure Service Fabric ###
*Ever wonder how Microsoft builds highly distributed services like Azure DocumentDB, Azure SQL DB, or even Cortana? Each of these services has a specialized purpose, but they share the need to be highly scalable, reliable and have extremely low latency. Azure Service Fabric is the platform under all of them, and it is purpose-built to solve exactly these challenges. More importantly, it is now available for you to build your own highly-scalable, reliable, low-latency services on top of!*

*Come see how Azure Service Fabric fits into the myriad of compute options offered by the Azure platform and if it is a good fit for your solutions. We'll look at how you can build either stateful, or stateless, microservices using this platform and how it differs from Azure Cloud Services.*
